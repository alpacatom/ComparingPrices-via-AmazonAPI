# ComparingPricesviaAmazonAPI
  We can check the price (converts to US dollars) of an item sold in 6 Amazons(.com/.co.uk/.de/.fr/.jp) at once when you buy one from japan.
  CurrencyAPI(https://currencylayer.com/) has been used to get currencies as well.
  
# How To Use
  Build it via Eclipse, and execute it.(maybe you need to import some libs.)
  There are some parameters that you have to set in order to search something.

# Comments
 - This is my first time to write in Java, so if you have some questions or suggestions, please tell me.
 - It sometimes clashes when the HTTP request is sent (I'm stil working for fixing).
 - Future Works: Making more functions like "Checking the price of multiple items".
